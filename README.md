In hospitals, the traditional practice of blood sample labeling relies heavily on handwritten labels. While this method has been used for a long time, its effectiveness in meeting the demands of modern healthcare is increasingly being questioned. The hospital laboratory environment, where precision is essential, is particularly vulnerable to the risks introduced by handwritten labels, which can compromise both patient safety and the accuracy of medical procedures. Handwritten labels are susceptible to issues such as illegibility, where unclear handwriting can lead to the misinterpretation of vital patient information. This issue is compounded by the natural variability in handwriting styles, which can create inconsistencies and complicate the accurate identification of blood samples. Such ambiguities have been known to cause delays as hospital staff struggle to interpret unclear information, increasing the potential for errors .


Several attempts have been made to mitigate the problems associated with handwritten labels, but these have often fallen short. The limited space on handwritten labels frequently leads to incomplete or abbreviated patient information, resulting in improperly recorded or missing details that are crucial for accurate blood sample processing and matching. Manual transcription of information from patient records to labels further introduces the possibility of errors, whether due to oversight, fatigue, or human error, with even minor mistakes having serious consequences in a medical setting. Additionally, the time-consuming nature of handwriting labels has been identified as a significant bottleneck in the processing of blood samples, particularly in critical situations where time is of the essence. The lack of standardization in  labeling practices across different hospital staff members has also been a major challenge, leading to inconsistencies that increase the likelihood of errors and reduce the overall efficiency of hospital operations 


Given the numerous challenges associated with the current system of handwritten labels, there is a clear and urgent need for innovation in blood sample labeling in Ghanaian hospitals. The limitations of the existing system not only pose a significant risk to patient safety but also hinder the ability of healthcare providers to deliver timely and accurate care. As healthcare demands continue to grow, these inefficiencies are expected to place even greater strain on already limited resources, making the need for a more reliable and standardized system increasingly urgent. In response to these challenges, a web-based system that utilizes QR codes and barcodes has been identified as a promising solution. This innovative approach has the potential to significantly reduce errors, enhance the accuracy of blood sample identification, and improve the overall efficiency of hospital operations. Implementing such a system would represent a crucial step forward in modernizing healthcare practices in Ghana, ensuring that patient safety is prioritized and that healthcare providers are equipped with the necessary tools to deliver the highest standard of care 


Problem Statement: The problem with the current blood sample labeling system in Ghanaian hospitals is that it is highly prone to errors due to its reliance on handwritten labels. These errors can result in the misidentification of blood samples, leading to inaccurate diagnoses and improper treatments that could endanger patient safety and delay vital medical care. Given the high stakes associated with blood sample management, there is an urgent need for a system that minimizes these risks by ensuring accurate and reliable labelling.


The  web-based platform utilizes barcode technology to efficiently manage and label blood samples in Ghanaian hospitals. The platform will enable the generation of both QR codes and barcodes, ensuring accurate identification and tracking of blood samples. This system is expected to address the current challenges associated with handwritten labels by providing a reliable, standardized, and efficient solution for blood sample management.



HOW TO USE THE WEB APPLICATION

When a hospital staff member, such as a nurse or lab technician, needs to label a patient's blood sample, they begin by accessing the digital blood sample labelling system through a web browser with the link. The system is designed to be user-friendly and accessible, allowing staff to quickly navigate to the necessary functionality.
Upon opening the web page, the staff member is presented with a straightforward form containing all the required fields for patient information. This includes critical details such as the patient's name, ID, age, gender, home address, blood type, and blood test results. The form is meticulously designed, with each input field clearly labelled to ensure the staff member understands exactly what information is needed.
To streamline the data entry process, the system incorporates dropdown menus for certain fields, such as gender and blood type. This not only promotes standardization but also helps prevent common data entry errors that can occur with manual typing. The staff member simply selects the appropriate option from the dropdown, confident that the information will be accurately captured.
Once all the necessary patient details have been provided, the staff member can then utilize the system's core functionality - the generation of digital labels. With the click of a button, the application generates a QR code and a barcode, both of which encode comprehensive patient information. These digital labels serve as a highly accurate and efficient means of identifying the blood sample, eliminating the risks associated with handwritten labels.
The staff member can then choose to print out the QR code and barcode, ensuring that the physical sample is properly labelled before being sent to the laboratory for analysis. This printing functionality is seamlessly integrated, allowing the staff to quickly and easily generate the necessary labels without any additional steps.
Furthermore, the system is designed with data persistence in mind. When the staff member submits the patient information, the application automatically stores the data in the user's browser, using the browser's local storage capabilities. This means that if the staff member needs to revisit the form, perhaps to make a correction or update, they can do so with the previously entered information pre-filled, saving valuable time and reducing the risk of data entry mistakes.
Underlying this user-facing functionality is a robust architecture that ensures the system's reliability and security. The web-based application is built using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leveraging external libraries for the generation of QR codes and barcodes.
